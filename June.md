# 📈 ONYX Data DNA Dashboard – June

## 🔍 Social Media Content Performance Analysis

Welcome to the **ONYX Data DNA Dashboard – June Edition**, a Power BI project that dives deep into the **performance of social media content** across platforms. This dashboard was created as part of the **Data DNA Challenge** and focuses on analyzing key performance metrics such as engagement, reach, and content effectiveness.

## 🧩 Project Overview

The goal of this dashboard is to analyze **social media content trends** by platform, region, and metric (such as likes, comments, shares, etc.). It helps content teams and marketers:

* Understand which posts are performing best
* Compare platforms side-by-side
* Navigate quickly between different visual views
* Interactively filter and explore insights using intuitive controls

While building this dashboard, I significantly **enhanced my Power BI skills** and had a lot of fun in the process!

## ✨ Key Features and Learnings

Here are some highlights of what I learned and implemented:

* 🔀 **Page Navigation**: Added navigation buttons that allow users to switch pages and apply filters that affect the whole report.
* 📌 **Bookmarks**: Used bookmarks to dynamically show/hide visuals depending on the metric selected, enabling a smoother user experience.
* 🎛️ **Selection Customization**: Customized slicers and filters for better interactivity and visual clarity.
* 🧭 **Filter Pane Customization**: Designed a custom filter pane for cleaner aesthetics and easier access to controls.
* 🎨 **Visual Polish**: Focused on design, layout, and consistency to ensure the dashboard is not only functional but also visually appealing.
